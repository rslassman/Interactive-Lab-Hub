# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Michelle is waiting in the living room of her apartment for her friend Lily to arrive so the two of them can go out for lunch. When Lily walks in she ask Michelle for a phone charger and says she needs a few minutes to charge her phone before they can leave. Lily plugs in her phone using the only outlet in the living room and the two of them sit down on the couch to catch up until the phone is fully charged. However, the only outlet is across the room from the couch so every few minutes Lily has to get up to check the battery percent.

Rather than getting up or having to check the phone every few minutes to see the battery percent, the Illumiated Phone Charger lights up when the phone is fully charged. This way Lily can be fully engaged in her conversation with Michelle, rather than continously interupting to check her phone, and be alterted only when the charging is complete. 
 

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*

Feedback was positive and students said it was a product they would be interested in. We also brainstormed additional features such as transforming the cable so it looks like a snake light, lighting up in proportion to the percentage charge of the phone for people who did not need to wait for 100%. Other ideas included the ability to personalize the colors and type of light that comes on at the end (flashing, brightness etc.)

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

The interaction is fairly simple and seemed to run smoothly when acted out in the same way as written on paper. However, I only had myself at the time so unlike in the storyboard, there was only one person in the acted out scenario rather than two. 

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

One new idea for displaying/communicating the battery percentage is having the lighting of the converter itself increase in brightness and then change color once complete. 

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

I was not able to get Tinkerbelle working on my mac. I was able to compelete all of the steps in terminal but the webpage never opened. 

## Part D. Wizard the device 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45234433/132157817-2b72c533-4e2c-468f-a184-a66c193d4a8b.mp4


\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

In this new interaction the goal is now for Lily to be notified at the battery percentage of her choosing (e.g. 60%) rather than 100%. This is incorporated by adding a new first step in which she sets the battery life threshold when the phone is first plugged into the charger, before she leaves it to charge. 

![Storyboard: 60% battery life](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45234433/132160007-6a987799-9918-448f-aa11-0c7ae377d2c1.jpg)


## Part E. Costume the device

The parts of the device (adapter and cable) already exist, what is new is the ability for either or both the be illuminated. In this way I did not costume the device but hung the device behind the TV on the wall above the charger so the flashing light would appear on the adapter as if it were actually coming from the adapter itself. For this iteration I focused on the flashing of the adapter to signal when the charging was complete.

![Device sketch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45234433/132160039-8d4fb259-f987-498f-8200-1c83500e6172.jpg)


\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

N/A. I did not costume the device. The device would look the same as it does today with different capabilities.

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

N/A. I did not costume the device. The device would look the same as it does today with different capabilities. People are familiar with the adapter cable setup for phone chargers and so it may be important to keep the same design. This would also enable other companies to incorporate a similar feature. 

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45234433/132157870-e6e1ba39-aa9f-4cb7-ad32-c0c667f900e9.mp4


\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*

This challenge of checking your phone while charging and thinking about ways that lighting could help in this situation was originally identified by Marvin Edmond during our in class group breakout room. As a group we then brainstormed the type of light notifications that could be incorporated.  

\*\***Reflections on the Process**\*\*

This was a fun process. The biggest takeaway was that it is most helpful to spend time updating the storyboard of time particularly in creating and updating the storyboard. 

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
